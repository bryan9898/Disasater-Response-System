# Disasater Response System
 Clouding Computing School Project

## Project Overview

This project develops a disaster management system utilizing the synergy of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and crowdsourcing. Designed to respond swiftly and accurately to disasters, this system enhances situational awareness and expedites decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to save lives and minimize economic losses.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Utilizes cloud computing to handle large volumes of data in real time.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Employs AI for analyzing images and texts to categorize and verify disaster-related incidents.
- **Crowdsourced Verification**: Integrates a community verification system to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected.
- **Scalable SaaS Platform**: Delivers a robust and scalable platform that continuously adapts and improves without significant downtime.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For hosting and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for real-time database operations and storage solutions.
- **TensorFlow and BERT models**: For AI and machine learning capabilities.
- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive frontend.
- **Node.js**: Serves as the backend server environment.
- **Twitter API**: Integrates social media data for enhanced situational awareness.
